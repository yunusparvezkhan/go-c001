## Go Programming
### Introduction
Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It has a much faster compilation system than most of other compiled languages.

### Usecases of Go
Go is a high-level programming language, which means that it is very human readable and not complex. Because it is a compiled programming language it can be used to build programs for operating systems that are supported by Go. Mostly Go is used for server-side programs in the industry, but that doesn't mean that it can not create client-side applications.

### Advantages of Go
Go comes with many advantages over other languages to program softwares.

1. Go is statically types
    
    - That means that Go requires it's programmers to declare the data type of a variable when declaring it. Many programmer likes this way because, it prevents accidental changing of the data type later during any value assignment. Many programmers however do like the automatic data type feature. But it is a advantage in Go that it requires declaration of data types, as this kind of programming languages are usually more efficient in runtime.
