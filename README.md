## Go Programming
### Introduction
Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It has a much faster compilation system than most of other compiled languages.

### Usecases of Go
Go is a high-level programming language, which means that it is very human readable and not complex. Because it is a compiled programming language it can be used to build programs for operating systems that are supported by Go. Mostly Go is used for server-side programs in the industry, but that doesn't mean that it can not create client-side applications.
