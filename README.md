### Repository Introduction
This repository contains all the notes and practical work in Go by me, following a course in YouTube by freeCodeCamp YouTube channel. To see the course click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un6ZyFkqFKo).

## Go Programming
### Introduction
Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It has a much faster compilation system than most of other compiled languages.

### Usecases of Go
Go is a high-level programming language, which means that it is very human readable and not complex. Because it is a compiled programming language it can be used to build programs for operating systems that are supported by Go. Mostly Go is used for server-side programs in the industry, but that doesn't mean that it can not create client-side applications.

### Advantages of Go
Go comes with many advantages over other languages to program softwares.

1. Go is statically types
    
    - That means that Go requires it's programmers to declare the data type of a variable when declaring it. Many programmer likes this way because, it prevents accidental changing of the data type later during any value assignment. Many programmers however do like the automatic data type feature. But it is a advantage in Go that it requires declaration of data types, as this kind of programming languages are usually more efficient in runtime.

1. Go is a compiled programming language

    - Compiled programming langage means that after the development of the app in the particular dev environment, a piece of software called as compiler, compiles the code into an executable file for that operating system. This executable file has no dependency and can run only on it's own and it is usually encrypted as well. This kind of programming languages are usually faster, more efficient and more secure as well.

1. High Level Programming Language

    - This point might sound like it is a disadvantage, because high level programming languages are usually slower than that of low level programming languages. But in the case of Go, it seems like it does not has that much of a problem being a high level programming language, added to that as a high level language it is has a very simple and human friendly syntax

1. Less compilation time

    - The disadvantage of the compiled programming languages are that they take way too much time to compile and ready the executable file. On the other hand dependency dependent programming languages (aka interpreted languages) takes absolutely zero time to execute. Howevery being a compiled language Go does take a very very very little time to compile compared to other compiled counterparts.
